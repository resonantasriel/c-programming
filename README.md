# c-programming
Some snippets of C low level memory programming I know.


## fun facts about me:
- i am very interested in making operating systems
- i've built quite a few operating systems myself.
- JavaScript programmers repulse me
- i can build ISAs and virtual memory utilizers with C


due to how secretive these are, i will not release them. sorry.
